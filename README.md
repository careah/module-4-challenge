#Pandas Challenge

In this assignment, youâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
Background

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


##Analysis

In this challenge, smaller and medium sized schools had better math and reading scores and an overall higher percentage passing rate, in addition to charter schools. In comparision, district schools and larger sized schools had lower math and reading scores. 

When you look at the spending range per student, the spending range per student has a higher passing rate for a lower range and based off of the other conclusions, the numbers seem backwards since charter schools tend to have a higher overall passing rate. I would look into this a bit more if this were actually my job.
